# BMI-Calculator
BMI surveillance programs assess the weight status of a specific population (for example, students in a class) to identify the percentage of students who are potentially at risk for weight-related health problems.

“BMI” is one such C++ program created to promote such programs in schools. The program is specially designed to store the records and BMI values of students of a particular class. It gives access for creating and modifying the data to only the administrators. But teachers can use it for surveillance purposes while students can use it for screening purposes.

The whole program is integrated with graphics to make it user friendly and more interesting. Along with the report, students and teachers can also view a graph to understand the analysis better. They can also view some tips to stay healthy.

Also, research has shown that well-designed, well-implemented programs can effectively promote physical activity and healthy eating. “BMI” is sure to do just this.

Program contains admin, student and teacher modules.
